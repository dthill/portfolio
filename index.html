          I am a web developer specialising in JavaScript and Typescript.
          <br />
          My career so far has had many twists and turns. I had the opportunity
          to work as a professional musician for almost a decade and tour around
          Europe. At the same time I had the chance to lead international
          workshops and tutor, teaching anything from music over performance art
          to English.
          <br />
          In web development I have found a new exciting career where I can
          apply many of the skills I have learned in my previous career be that
          creativity, problem solving, communicating effectively with people
          from different backgrounds or working in a tight knit team under
          pressure.
          <br />
          Being a developer gives me the continued opportunity to learn, be
          creative and experiment with new projects in my freetime, some of
          which you can find bellow.
          <br />
          I am currently working as a web developer in Basel, Switzerland while
          I am continuing to further develop my programming skills.
          <br />
          When I am not working on web applications I like to cycle and travel.

            <p class="card__text">
              This is an open source library for Angular I wrote to mock backend
              data requests and replace them with static JSON files. <br />
              This library grew out of the repeated need for this functionality
              as part of multiple projects where the backend development is not
              progressing as quickly as the frontend and therefore it is
              convenient to define an API and then mock the data with static
              JSON files. <br />
              The library is tested with unit tests using Angular's default
              Karma and Jasmine combination. To cover end-to-end testing, basic
              Cypress tests were also added to the project. <br />
              To showcase how the library works and can be used, a basic demo
              project is also included in the repository helping with the
              provided documentation to make using the library easy for
              beginners. <br />
              The library is published on npm and open-source.

            <p class="card__text">
              This is a rebuild of the Endless Wiki Viewer with Angular. It has
              very similar functionality to the React rebuild and also very
              similar styling. <br />
              I rebuild the same app in Angular to understand the differences in
              Angular and React. I also wanted to get a better understanding of
              the design patterns and ideas behind both. Similar to the other
              two builds dealing with iframes was difficult and due to the way
              that Angular’s DOMSanitizer works I had to find a different
              approach to displaying the content of an article in an iframe.
              <br />
              Unlike the React version the Angular version has a router
              implemented. Future editions could improve the user experience by
              allowing keyboard navigation and opening links inside an article
              in a new window.

              This is a rebuild of the Endless Wiki Viewer with React. Users can
              still scroll through endless Wikipedia extracts and view them on
              the page.
              <br />
              I rebuild the same app to focus on learning React, to simplify it
              and to focus on the most important functions of the app and
              improve those. Similarly to the first build I learned a lot about
              how to handle iframes. What was new in this was the React part and
              how to deal with the state in React. In addition I used React
              Styled-Components to deal with encapsulating the styles inside the
              components in JavaScript.
              <br />
              A future version of this could include the use of React Router or
              Gatsby.js to add address bar navigation, forward/backwards history
              support and bookmark possibilities to the app.

              This is a Node and Express web application that allows the
              real-time sharing of notes through a shared permalink. Each note
              has a unique permalink that can be shared at will. The note is
              updated in real-time through websocket use. If notes are not
              needed anymore they can be deleted by the user.
              <br />
              This was a project to learn to use real-time web technologies.
              Initially I used socket.io on the backend and frontend but I later
              rewrote the code to just use WS on the backend and use vanilla
              JavaScript on the frontend. I used HashIDs and a counter in the
              database to create unique short IDs as permalinks.
              <br />
              It would be interesting to try to make this scalable. The
              websocket implementation would have to change and probably involve
              a database of all the connected clients to make it work.

              haikus if enough votes are collected. A removed haiku is stored
              for 30 days during which time it can be restored if it receives
              more restoring votes than it has removing votes. The app is fully
              responsive and work on phones and tablets.
              <br />
              This was a project to learn and improve my PHP and MySQL skills.
              It implements a CRUD RESTful API that is used in conjunction with
              AJAX. In the process of writing this I learned a lot about
              security, dealing with and avoiding SQL injection and cross-site
              scripting. This uses again my version of Handlebars templating
              code adapted for this project.

              Unfortunately this app is on a free webhost that is rather
              unreliable so I am sorry if you cannot try this app.

              This is a frontend web-application using vanilla JavaScript and
              Bootstrap 4. It creates an endless scrolling feed of Wikipedia
              articles that can be viewed in the app and saved in the
              localstorage of the device. The app is fully responsive and works
              on phones and tablets.
              <br />
              This was mainly a project to learn about AJAX requests to
              established APIs. In the end I also learned a lot more about DOM
              manipulation, event delegation and the tricks and problems of CSS
              styling for iOS and mobile devices in general. The first version
              also used Handlebars for templating but I later wrote my own code
              for templating using the same principle as Handlebars.
              <br />
              A future version of this could include a Vue or React frontend.

              This was the first JavaScript game I wrote. It is a Pong clone
              developed using vanilla JavaScript and the canvas API. It is
              responsive and can be played on phones and tablets.
              <br />
              This was mainly a project to learn about the basics of JavaScript
              and the basic use of the canvas API. This was also my first
              project to be put on GitHub another skill I learned through this
              project.
